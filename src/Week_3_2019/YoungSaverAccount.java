//This is the trickiest one if you see I use extend deposit account. Do not worry about that that is
// becouse i need to use the same Withdraw method as the deposit account and i will still be pathed to my account like this
// YoungsaverAccount-Depositaccount-Account so it will work fine. And now i got 2 Super classes Account and Depositaccount
// but that is no problem. Actually deposit is a superclass for Youngsavers account and a subclass to account class
// so it works like a connection.
// I have change it now so if you look AGAIN my youngsavers account and student account are subclasses of deposit account
// becouse i need the intrestrate rate method inn  all classes eccept my Current Account class still works becouse
// youngsaveacc and student acc - deposit account - account so it have apath
